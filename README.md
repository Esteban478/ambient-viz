# Audio Visualizer

This project is an interactive audio visualizer built with React, Three.js, and the Web Audio API. It provides a dynamic 3D visualization that responds to audio input in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time audio analysis and visualization
- 3D cube that changes size, color, and position based on audio frequencies
- Smooth transitions and animations
- User authentication with Firebase
- Ability to upload and play audio files

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Three.js
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei
- Web Audio API
- Firebase Authentication
- Zustand for state management

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up a Firebase project and add your configuration
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`
2. Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual Firebase configuration

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex visualizations
- Implement audio effects and filters
